Our staff can perform assessments and services through a live, secure, video connection (similar to FaceTime or Zoom). This cuts out travel and waiting time and can be done in your home or office with a stable internet connection (use of a computer is recommended/preferred). We do our best to make it as convenient and simple as possible for you! </p>
