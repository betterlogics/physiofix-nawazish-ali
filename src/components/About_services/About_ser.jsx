<p className='left'>Whether you have an existing injury or want to prevent injury, we start with a comprehensive assessment to learn your injury history, tolerance level, your goals, and identify any weaknesses in mobility, flexibility, strength, stability, and functional movement patterns. With the data from the assessment, we create an individualized physical therapy program tailored to your specific needs. We accept BCBS insurance and offer the popular self-pay option. Our clinicians work with you 1-on-1 for the entire 60-minute visit to help you recover from injuries and strengthen any deficiencies that prevent you from being the strongest version of you!</p>
