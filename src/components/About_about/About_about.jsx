                    <p className='left '>After earning her doctorate degree in 2015, Dr. Stacie took her first job as a physical therapist in a traditional outpatient orthopedic and sports physical therapy clinic. As she was settling into the profession, she became increasingly frustrated with the level of patient care she could provide. Her time with patients was profoundly restricted so the clinic could churn through visits to maximize income. In addition to being rushed through in-person treatment, she had volumes of documentation she had to fit in at the end of the day to keep insurance companies happy. By year two, Dr. Stacie was on the verge of burn-out, tired of feeling like she wasn’t putting her skillset to the best use and like she worked for insurance carriers instead of her patients…so she created her own solution…by taking the leap into solopreneurship!</p>
